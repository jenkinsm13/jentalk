# Jentalk IDE
## ∃|>○« - Discover the Language of Collaboration

Welcome to the Jentalk IDE, an innovative development environment designed to facilitate the creation, visualization, and debugging of Jentalk language expressions. Jentalk, a language of symbols and modifiers, captures the essence of entities and their interactions in a unique and expressive way.

## Features
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-coded feedback for Jentalk primitives and modifiers to enhance readability and ease of understanding.
- **Auto-completion**: Intelligent suggestions for Jentalk tokens to streamline the coding process.
- **Debugging Tools**: Step through your Jentalk expressions with breakpoints, step-over, and execution tracing.
- **Visualization Components**: Generate graphical representations of reasoning graphs and trees of thought to visualize the structure of Jentalk expressions.
- **Customizable Editor**: A text editor that supports custom font sizes and styles tailored to your preferences.

## Installation
To set up the Jentalk IDE on your local machine, clone this repository and ensure you have Python installed. The IDE relies on Tkinter for the GUI, which is included in standard Python distributions.

```
git clone https://github.com/jenkinsm13/jentalk.git
cd Jentalk
```

## Usage
Run the Jentalk IDE by executing the main script:

```
python jentalk_ide.py
```

Once the IDE is running, you can create new Jentalk files, open existing ones, and save your work. Use the toolbar buttons or the menu options to manage your files.

## Keyboard Commands
The Jentalk IDE provides a set of keyboard commands to enhance the user experience:

- **Generate Tree of Thought Graph**: Press Ctrl+t to visualize the current text as a tree diagram.
- **Generate Reasoning Graph**: Press Ctrl+r to create a reasoning graph from the Jentalk expressions.
- **Set Breakpoint**: Use the command from the Tools menu to set a breakpoint for debugging.
- **Resume Execution**: Use the command from the Tools menu to resume execution from a breakpoint.

## Known Issues
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The syntax highlighting feature is not fully reliable and may not correctly highlight all Jentalk tokens.
- **Auto-completion**: The auto-completion functionality is currently not functioning as expected. It may not provide the correct suggestions or could cause errors.
- **PDF Labels**: The labels in the generated PDF outputs for the visualization graphs are not as detailed as they should be. The high-level categories are listed, while the intention is to list the exact token or its attached English modifier.
